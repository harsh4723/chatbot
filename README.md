# chatbot
We have built a terminal bot that brings to you headlines of the day in about 20 languages, which can also be opened in your default browser.
User can choose from leading news dailies like The Hindu, Times of India and Hindustan times, or from categories like sports, tech and entertainment.
Then, our bot will come up with related headlines. Not just that, on choosing a particular article, our bot texts a summary of it. If the 
user wants to visit the page and read in detail, even that could be done.
